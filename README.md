Using Blender and Python

  Blender has an embedded Python interpreter which is loaded when Blender is started and stays active while Blender is running. This interpreter runs scripts to draw the user interface and is used for some of Blender’s internal tools as well.

Blender’s embedded interpreter provides a typical Python environment, so code from tutorials on how to write Python scripts can also be run with Blender’s interpreter. Blender provides its Python modules, such as bpy and mathutils, to the embedded interpreter so they can be imported into a script and give access to Blender’s data, classes, and functions. Scripts that deal with Blender data will need to import the modules to work.
